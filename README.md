I have no idea what is read me. But i think you read it.

How to use it:
1.Enter a text and press enter
2.Enter any key. Think it like settin a password. Then press enter.
3.Now either copy the encripted text to your clipboard using the button. Or, clear the text.
4.share the encripted text with your friends online and give the key to them physically.
5.Now your friend can download the application too and paste the text and the key you gave.
6.From now on you and your friend can share messages secretly using the first key you made(because it was given physically, it's integrety is quite strong)
7.As for the encrypted text, it is quite secure. Because i used binary x-or encryption. But, hackers may crack it because the encryption is no too complex.


Something More:
This is my first complete program. I used Tkinter gui framework in python. took me some hours to make the encryption. but took me a day to make the gui interface. 

All props goes to my Mentor. Who joined me in this amazing world of programming. And the free youtube tutorials.
